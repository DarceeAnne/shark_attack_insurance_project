# Shark Attacks Data Analysis

This project aims to analyze a dataset containing information about shark attacks. The dataset was initially messy and required extensive cleaning and preprocessing before analysis. The analysis is intended to support Analytix Assurance in developing models for various insurance products, particularly for assessing risk in travel insurance based on the likelihood of shark attacks.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning:** The dataset was cleaned to remove empty rows, standardize text formats, and categorize various columns such as activity, injury, and country.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Exploratory analysis was conducted to understand the distribution of various factors such as the type of attack, fatal outcomes, geographical locations, and trends over time.

3. **Data Visualization:** Visualizations such as bar plots, line plots, and count plots were created to illustrate patterns and trends in shark attacks.

4. **Insights:** Based on the analysis, insights were derived to understand factors contributing to shark attacks, identify high-risk activities and locations, and assess the frequency and severity of incidents over time.

## Analytical Findings

- **Fatalities:** A significant portion of shark attacks resulted in fatalities, highlighting the importance of understanding and mitigating risks associated with shark encounters.

- **Geographical Distribution:** Shark attacks are not evenly distributed globally, with certain regions experiencing higher incidence rates than others. Countries such as Australia, the USA, and South Africa are among the locations with a relatively high number of reported attacks.

- **Temporal Trends:** The frequency of shark attacks varies over time, with some years experiencing higher incident rates than others. Understanding temporal trends can help insurers assess risk factors and adjust coverage accordingly.

- **Risk Factors:** Activities such as swimming, surfing, and diving are associated with a higher risk of shark attacks compared to other recreational activities. Insurers can use this information to tailor insurance products based on the type of activity and location.

## Usage Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are provided for Analytix Assurance:

- Develop risk models: Utilize the insights gained from the analysis to develop predictive models that assess the likelihood of shark attacks based on various factors such as location, activity, and time of year.

- Customize insurance products: Tailor travel insurance products to account for the varying risk levels associated with different activities and destinations. Offer higher coverage or premiums for travelers visiting high-risk locations or engaging in activities with a higher likelihood of shark encounters.

- Educate customers: Provide educational resources and safety guidelines to travelers to minimize the risk of shark attacks and ensure they are adequately prepared in the event of an emergency.

## Conclusion

The analysis of shark attack data provides valuable insights for Analytix Assurance to develop effective insurance products and risk assessment strategies. By leveraging data-driven approaches and understanding the factors contributing to shark attacks, insurers can better serve their customers and mitigate potential risks associated with travel to coastal regions and engaging in water-related activities.
